[1]ODETTE:: Seems to be working so far.
[2]PANG:: I'm speaking a new language! Don't interrupt still...
[1]ODETTE:: wat.
[0]PANG:: Okay, now interrupt me if you can.

[1]ODETTE:: This is the next line after the break.
[0]PANG:: Did it work?

[0]PANG:: You'll know when it happens.
[0]ODETTE:[R1]: I don't have time for this, Pang!
[0]ODETTE:[R2]: Why can't you just give me a straight answer?
[0]ODETTE:[R3]: How long should we wait then?
[0]ODETTE:[R4]: Wait. Did you hear that?
[1]PANG:[R1]: Then make time, damn it! This is important.
